## Intro

### Python Use Cases

* Python can be used on a server to create web applications.

* Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.

* Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.

* Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.

* Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

### How to write python

* Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.

* Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.

* Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
